Agri-Plast API Tutorial
=======================

This tutorial will guide on how to obtain and analyze data from Agri-Plast project, a collaborative research, development, and innovation project dedicated to reducing agricultural plastic waste (resíduos de plástico de uso agrícola, RPUA).

Here, two datasets will be used:

- First, a simple "hands-on" Temperature vs Humidity dataset from measurements in a glasshouse where *Vaccinium corymbosum* (blueberry) plants exposed to soil microplastics have grown.

- A second one, more detailed where physiological changes - particularly in the photosynthetic system - of *Vaccinium corymbosum* plants were addressed in control conditions in comparison with plants in contaminated soil with two different MPs concentrations - Low (0.001%(w/w)) and High (0.05%(w/w)).

All Agri-Plast datasets can be accessed through the Dataverse portal at:
